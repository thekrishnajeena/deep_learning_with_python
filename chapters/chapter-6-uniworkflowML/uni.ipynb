    "# Universal workflow of ML, three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- define the task\n",
    "- develop a model\n",
    "- deploy the model\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concept drift\n",
    "occurs when the properties of the production data change over time, causing model accuracy to graduallly decay.\n",
    "\n",
    "### understand the data\n",
    "\n",
    "### to control something, you need to be able to observe it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prepare the data\n",
    "\n",
    "basics that are common to all data domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vectorization\n",
    "all inputs and targets in a NN must be tensors of floating-point data(in specific cases, tensors of integers or strings), data vectorization\n",
    "\n",
    "### Value Normalization\n",
    "before feeding data into our network, had to normalize each feature independently so that it had a standard deviation of 1 and a mean of 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "to make learning easier for the network, data should have the following characteristics: \n",
    "\n",
    "- take small values: typically in the 0-1 range\n",
    "- be homogenous: all features should take values in roughly the same range.\n",
    "\n",
    "not necessary(but can help)\n",
    "- normalize each feature independently to have a mean of 0\n",
    "- normalize each feature independently to have a standard deviation of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "with numpy arrays: \n",
    "- x -= x.mean(axis=0) #samples\n",
    "- x /= x.std(axis=0)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling missing values\n",
    "\n",
    "- if the feature is categorical, safe to create a new category that means \"the value is missing\"\n",
    "- if the feature is numerical, safe to replace the missing value with the average or median value for the feature in the dataset, could also train a model to predict the feature given the value of other features\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choose an evaluation protocol\n",
    "the goal of validaiton protocol is to accurately estimate what your success metric of choice(such as accuracy) will be on production data. the reliability of that process is critical to building a useful model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Beat a baseline\n",
    "initial goal when working on the model is to achieve statistical power.\n",
    "\n",
    "three most important things to focus on : \n",
    "\n",
    "- feature engineering\n",
    "- selectin the correct architecture priors\n",
    "- selecting a good enough training configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scale up: Develop a model that overfits\n",
    "to figure out how big a model is needed, develop a model that overfits:\n",
    "- add layers\n",
    "- make the layers bigger\n",
    "- train for more epochs\n",
    "\n",
    "### regularize and tune your model\n",
    "\n",
    "### deploy the model\n"
